## Rationale

In the process of updating this pack to current versions of Minecraft, some textures have sneaked in which are verbatim copies of original Minecraft textures. This is of course in violation of both CC-BY-SA 4.0 used by this texture pack as well as Minecraft's own license conditions. Hence these textures have to be replaced by original work as soon as possible and removed from this pack until a replacement is ready. This list is an attempt to identify and track the status of those textures.
