# Pixel Perfection Community Edition (CE)

A 16x resolution resource pack for Minecraft™ by Mojang AB. Originally [envisioned and created by XSSheep](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1242533-pixel-perfection-now-with-polar-bears-1-11), updated by the community to support recent Minecraft versions.

Supported Minecraft version (Java Edition): 1.15.2

## Description

This resource pack has been originally published by XSSheep in 2012 and has seen continous updates by its creator until February 2019. Since then several members of the Minecraft community ([see below](#contributors)) stepped in to provide updates and content to maintain compatibility with recent Minecraft versions. Since XSSheep had the foresight to publish her/his work under a creative common license which allows alteration and redistribution, I decided to take what the community has achieved so far and to put it in a repository where the community can continue to collaborate to keep this great resource pack alive and thriving.
